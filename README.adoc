This is an attempt in making a reproducible and declarative desktop management ala\-link:https://nixos.org/[NixOS] (and  link:https://guix.gnu.org/[Guix]).




== Resources

This configuration may evolve into an abominable framework of configuration over time.
At some point, it won't be the simple "Hello World"-esque reference for Ansible.
If you're looking where to start learning about this, I've saved a list of them from the beginning:

* link:https://fedoramagazine.org/using-ansible-setup-workstation/[Fedora Magazine's article with a very simple example.]
This is where I first found about it and the very beginning of the Ansible usage journey.

* The link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/index.html[user guide from the official documentation].

* Some already existing configurations laying out and about on the internet...
** link:https://gitlab.com/jwflory/swiss-army/[Justin W. Flory's Ansible playbooks] are a nice example on getting a complete configuration with Ansible.
** link:https://github.com/fabaff/fedora-ansible/[fabaff's Ansible playbook for Fedora] is a perfect example for Fedora-specific configurations and it is simpler compared to the previously mentioned examples.
** link:https://github.com/89luca89/ansible-fedora-minimal[89luca89's Ansible playbook for a minimal Fedora installation.] It's a simpler example than the previous making it easier to explore the features.
